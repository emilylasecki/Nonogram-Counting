Picross/Nonograms is a puzzle game involving m x n grids where the player must fill in tiles based on a list of clues. These clues dictate the order and number of tiles that must be filled in, but leaves out information on how big gaps of no color are. This principle of giving some information but not all of it makes for a fun game, but presents many mathmatical questions. For a more detailed explanation on picross, I recommend https://webpbn.com/ as a first resource. For the use of explanations (mostly for myself) I refer to a solvable grid as unique if there exists exactly one grid that fits the provided clues. A grid is not-unique if the provided instructions can lead to more than one version of the grid. A grid is not-solvable if the provided instructions do not produce any grids. I am focusing on the former two with this program.

I noticed a simple pattern in the 2x2 grid that is not-unique; it looks like a tiny checkerboard. There exists two out of sixteen combinations that are not uniquely solvable. But what about 3x3 grids? That's a little harder to brute force, so that's where programming comes in. To start I aim at counting possible grids and then expanding to this question of "uniqueness" with averages and stuff (that I currently don't know enough about to accurate access how big a sample size I need, but thats a future me problem).

Another element of this game is color. If a puzzle has more than one color, those two colors don't need a blank gap to seperate them. This alters some solving techniques from the simple single color grid. It also presents more questions about uniqueness. To start, I want to calculate the number of possible grids of several colors and several sizes. Turns out this is a fantastic place to use the Principle of Inclusion Exclusion (PIE). I want to take these findings and export them into an excel file to notice trends, specifically at how many colors do fewer grids become possible. I believe adding more colors makes grids more solvable, but I'm also curious about the ration of possible grids to unique ones. 

Line logic is the term used to describe using the clues from a single row or colmun to solve that line. This can include finding tiles that must be filled a certain color or must be white, along with solving the whole line. Edge logic is when solving a line along the edge of the border helps determine more squares in other lines. These two strategies can get you pretty far, but advanced puzzles make use of other techniques. Snaking is a version of this, that has only one solution but line logic won't get you there. (somehow i need to include an example here) For the simplcity of my program, I plan on marking these cases as ambiguous and re-evaluating how to handle these cases later. 

Further questions can be asked about Picross, such as how many boards exist that require more than line and edge logic to be solved. 

I am using Github to track my progress and log issues, along with notes in a seperate journal. Stay tuned :)
