# Nonograms Principle of Inclusion Exclusion

This project has been completed. For results and a more thorough explanation of nonograms, please view Conclusions.pdf.

Nonograms is a puzzle game involving m x n grids where the player must fill in tiles or leave them blank based on a list of clues. These clues dictate the order and number of tiles that must be filled in, but leaves out information on how big gaps of no color are. This principle of giving some information but not all of it makes for a fun game, but presents many mathematical questions. For a more detailed explanation on nonograms, I recommend https://webpbn.com/ as a first resource. Navigate to forums and find the post #99 by Jan Wolter for solving techniques. 

For the use of explanations, I refer to a solvable grid as unique if there exists exactly one grid that fits the provided clues. A grid is not unique if the provided instructions can lead to more than one version of the grid. A grid is not solvable if the provided instructions do not produce any grids. I am focusing on the former two with this program.

I noticed a simple pattern in the 2x2 grid that is not unique; it looks like a tiny checkerboard. There exist two out of sixteen combinations that are not uniquely solvable. This is refered to as a switching component, and these possibilities become more and more frequent as grids become larger. But what about 3x3 grids? That's a little harder to brute force, so that's where programming comes in. To start, I aim at counting possible grids and then expanding to this question of "uniqueness".

Another element of this game is color. If a puzzle has more than one color, those two colors don't need a blank gap to separate them. This alters some solving techniques from the simple single-color grid. It also presents more questions about uniqueness. To start, I want to calculate the number of possible grids of several colors and several sizes. I then want to take these findings and export them into an excel file to notice trends, specifically at how many colors do fewer grids become possible. This is the sole goal of this repository. I believe adding more colors makes grids more solvable, but I'm also curious about the ratio of possible grids to unique ones, which will require a little more programming.

This program counts all possible grids of each size with each color, ignoring uniqueness for the time being. A 2x2 grid with one color is as simple as taking each of the four squares and choosing to color it in or not. But we need to subtract the case where no colors are selected, which is 1 board this gives 2^4 -1 =15. The 2x2 grid with 2 colors can be calculated in a similar way. Let’s call the two colors blue and black. First, we calculate the total number of boards with no restrictions, 3^4 (3 colors, because we choose blue, black, or to leave the square alone). Now, 3^4 counts cases where blue or black may never be selected and only one color is present, so we subtract all cases where only blue and black are present. So, we subtract 2^4 twice or 2(2^4) or 32. This subtracts the blank board twice, so we need to add the blank board in once to have an accurate result. This leaves us with 3^4 – 2(2^4) +1 = 50. This is the Principle of Inclusion Exclusion.

I plan on exporting this data into an Excel sheet to be referenced easier and turn it into a graph. Afterwards, I plan on creating a new repository where I create a nonogram game from the ground up. I will randomly generate codes for certain games and test multiple size grids with multiple colors to find on average how many boards are unique with each specification. I then will compare the ratio of possible boards with unique ones to establish how this trend changes with the grids being scaled up and/or number of colors being altered.

I am using GitHub to track my progress and log issues. README.md serves as a general background of the project. For a more detailed log of progress read PROGRESSLOG.md. For final evaluations and project next-steps see Conclusions.pdf.
